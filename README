This is the Correctly Rounded Quadrature library (CRQ)
version 0.0.20060215.

I. OVERVIEW
===========

CRQ is a set of functions computing the numerical integral of a
function over a closed interval. Newton-Cotes rules and Gauss-Legendre
rules are provided. It support composition and {weights, points}
precomputations.

II. HOW TO INSTALL
==================

You need to have MPFR [1] installed. Modifiy config.mk to match your
setup, then build with `make'. This builds the static library
`libcrq.a'.
